    "The LCF Model Fully Automatic Capsule Filling Machine sets new standards in pharmaceutical manufacturing, boasting an impressive capacity of filling up to 90,000 capsules per hour. This advanced machine offers unparalleled accuracy, accommodating a wide range of hard gelatin capsule sizes from 00 to 4, and can handle various formulations, including granules, powder, or pellets, either individually or in combinations, with exceptional precision. Employing cutting-edge tamping pin technology, the Automatic Capsule Filler ensures precise filling and sealing of capsules, reflecting the company's over 20 years of expertise in designing filling machinery.",
    "Controlled by a programmable logic controller with a user-friendly touch-enabled interface from 'Siemens,' the machine offers effortless operation and customization to meet diverse application needs. With multiple models available, it can produce a minimum of 25,000 capsules, scaling up to an impressive 90,000 capsules per hour. Ensuring smooth operations, a 3-phase power supply is recommended for the machine, while its dosing tools guarantee high efficiency, contributing to its widespread adoption in pharmaceutical industries. Constructed from durable stainless steel 316/304 frames, the fully automatic capsule filler ensures stability and longevity.",
    "Complementing the machine's efficiency are several auxiliary equipments within the automatic capsule filling line. These include the Automatic Capsule Sorter Elevator, Metal Detector, Automatic Capsule Polishing Machine, Empty Capsule Ejector, and Damage Capsule Sorter. From feeding high-quality empty capsules to detecting any metal traces in the content, and from removing dust particles to sorting out distorted capsules, each equipment plays a vital role in optimizing the overall operation, ensuring product quality and efficiency at every stage."
